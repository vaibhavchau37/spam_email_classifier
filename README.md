## ‚ú® Features

- **Email Classification**: Analyzes email text to determine if it's spam or legitimate
- **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with real-time feedback
- **Confidence Visualization**: Visual gauge showing classification confidence
- **Sample Emails**: Pre-loaded examples for quick testing
- **Detailed Analysis**: Shows key features that influenced the classification

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model training
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing and text preprocessing
- **Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and confidence gauge

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-classifier.git
   cd email-spam-classifier
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the spam classifier:

```bash
python spam_classifier_ui.py
```

## üîç How It Works

1. **Data Processing**: The application uses a machine learning model (Naive Bayes) trained on email data
2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Lowercase conversion
   - Punctuation and number removal
   - Stopword removal
   - Stemming (reducing words to their root form)
3. **Classification**: The model analyzes the processed text and provides a classification with confidence score
4. **Visualization**: Results are displayed both textually and visually

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- Add ability to load emails from files
- Implement additional machine learning models
- Add support for training on custom datasets
- Create a web-based version
